          <br />
          </strong><strong>SECTION 1. UCC SELECTION<br />
          </strong>
          <p>At least eight UCCs shall be selected by a panel comprising the Executive Committee, Resident Associates, and current Head UCC. This may include a nomination and interview process, as deemed appropriate by the panel. The selection of UCCs must be done prior to card and room picks.</p>
          <p><strong>SECTION 2. UCC ALLEY AND ROOM ASSIGNMENT<br />
          </strong>The selected UCCs will participate in the card pick as normal members of the house. During room picks, each UCC will pick in the order determined by their (or their roommate's) card selection. After an alley has been chosen by a UCC, no other UCC may chose a room in that alley. If there is only one non-freshman room left in an alley, and that alley does yet have a UCC, the remaining room will be reserved for a UCC. <br />
          If there are more than eight UCCs chosen for the house, the remaining n-8 UCCs are not guaranteed rooms in the house and will pick according to their card selection. After all eight alleys have a UCC, the remaining UCCs may pick a room in any alley (if their card selection is high enough).</p>

          <h2>ARTICLE XI - ROOM PICKS</h2>
          <hr><br /><p>
            <strong>SECTION 1. SECRETARY&rsquo;S ROLE</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            The Secretary of Page House shall be responsible for its room picks, and shall be the final arbiter of all disputes regarding room picks. He or she shall be responsible for any and all facets of the room selection process, including the running of any meeting regarding room picks, liaison with the Housing Office or the MOSH, or the resolution of any questions regarding singles. The Secretary is responsible for keeping all records pertaining to the living arrangements in the house, including room lists, singles lists, phone lists, etc.</p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>SECTION 2. CARD PICKS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            At times and places to be determined by the Secretary, each member of the house who wishes to live on campus will pick two cards. One will determine the member&rsquo;s ranking in the doubles pick list, while the second will determine the member&rsquo;s ranking in the singles list. No member will be allowed to draw cards until he or she has declared a roommate, with the exception of the President. No member shall be allowed to change roommates after his/her cards have been drawn. When the appointed time period for drawing cards has expired, the Secretary must make public the ordered lists.</p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>SECTION 3. CARD ORDER</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            The card picks shall be ordered in the normal manner (i.e. aces high). If two cards are numerically the same, then the high card order shall be spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. If two people pick identical cards, then there will be a draw between the two people to determine which person is higher. All seniors that draw shall be higher than all juniors that draw, and juniors are above sophomores. In other words, the best sophomore pick is still lower than the worst junior pick. If an off campus member who was not kicked off the previous year decides to move back on campus in the year following room picks, he or she will automatically go to the bottom of his or her class on both lists. However, if such an individual moves back on campus before room picks, he or she will only go to the bottom of his or her class on the doubles list.</p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>SECTION 4. BONUSES</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            Certain officers of Page House are entitled to bonuses on their singles or doubles picks.<br />

          <p>Bonuses for the Executive Committee become effective at the room picks after elections. Social team and ath team double bonuses become effective at the room picks before their term has been served.  Singles bonuses apply for the year following elections. The only officer bonus that becomes effective immediately is the President&rsquo;s single bonus. Immediately upon his or her election, the President goes to the top of the singles list. None of these bonuses may be applied to obtaining an off campus Page room. Bonuses are not cumulative. That is, if a person is a member of the social team and the athletic team, he or she does not receive a +6 doubles pick. However, if a person is a member of the social team and is also historian, they do receive both bonuses, as one pertains to a doubles pick and the other to a singles pick. For room pick purposes, if there is more than one officer in any one class, the order shall go as follows: President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Athletic Manager. </p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>SECTION 5. PICKING ROOMS</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            At the room pick meeting, the Secretary will call for each member to make his or her room selection, in the order dictated by the doubles list. The suggested time limit for each person to make their room selection is five minutes, although certain factors might lengthen the time limit. After a person has selected a room, the Secretary simply call the next person on the ordered doubles list. When roommates are picking a room, they simply use the highest pick between the two of them.<br />
  </p>
          <p><strong>SECTION 6. ROOMMATES</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            At the beginning of every school year, each member living in Page House will have a roommate, with the exception of the President. Roommates must live together for at least one term, or until one or both of the roommates obtains a single, moves off campus, or leaves the House or the Institute. As with all concerns regarding Page House room picks, it will be the Secretary&rsquo;s job to deal in good faith with all members of the House. </p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>SECTION 7. SINGLES</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            The singles list will be utilized when a member moves off campus, or whenever a space becomes available in an on campus alley. There is a set of rules that the Secretary must follow whenever a space or spaces become available. </p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>All available rooms must       be offered to every member, in the order established by the singles list.</li>
              <li>If one of two roommates       decides to take a single, the person taking the single has to move. If       the person not taking a single is agreeable to moving, however, the       person taking a single could conceivably keep his or her room as a       single, while his or her roommate moves. However, if no such agreement       can be reached, the person taking the single room will have to move. </li>
              <li>The one exception to the       above rule is that neither corner double may be taken as a single.</li>
              <li>Once a person has taken a       single, their name is scratched off of the singles list for the remainder       of the school year, and they may not pick another single. However, in       passing up a particular room as a single, a person does not relinquish       his or her rights to pick a later single that might become available.</li>
              <li>Singles can be taken away in the order they were granted if a member of the
              house wishes to move on campus.</li>
              <li>Talking and dealing       between the various members involved in taking and relinquishing singles       is certainly encouraged. The Secretary shall assist in these negotiations       and shall oversee the entire process by proposing solutions starting at       the time that the new single becomes available. It is the Secretary&rsquo;s job       to make sure that an equitable living arrangement is produced as a result       of these dealings. As long as the above three rules are followed, and the       Secretary and parties involved deal in good faith, any other living       arrangement that can be reached is acceptable.</li>
              <li>All members must be moved       within one week of the time that a new single becomes available. If no       agreement can be reached by the members themselves, the Secretary shall       suggest a reasonable arrangement and moving shall commence so as to be       completed by the one-week time limit.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>SECTION 8. INVOLUNTARY MOVES</strong><strong> </strong><br />
            Whenever the number of incoming freshman is greater than the number of available spaces, certain upperclassmen will be asked to move off campus to make room for them.</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>The bottom picks from the       sophomore and junior classes will have to move off campus in equal       proportion to their on campus numbers to satisfy the guarantee that all       freshmen have housing their first year.</li>
              <li>One is considered to be       forced or involuntarily moved off campus if one is denied a room in the       house during room picks and if one does not move into the house by the       end of the fifth week of first term.</li>
              <li>If a person is       involuntarily moved off campus, and if they wish to move back on campus,       they do not go to the bottom of their class in the doubles rankings. They       pick normally, with whatever bonuses they might have.</li>
              <li>In any case, no person       may be involuntarily moved off campus more than once.</li>
